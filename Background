Thesis undertaken as part of my undergaduate degree in Applied Physics.

Researched different applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the natural sciences. 

Algorithm designed to detect a fibril within TEM image.

There's lots of issues with this code and the algorithm itself. Python was self-taught in a couple of weeks for the sole purpose of this
project and the tools (Keras and Tensorflow) were learnt ad-hoc just to get everything working.
